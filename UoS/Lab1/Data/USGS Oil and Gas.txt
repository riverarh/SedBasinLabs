Abstract:	This shapefile includes arcs and polygons that describe U.S. Geological Survey delineated Total Petroleum Systems of the World. Each petroleum system is defined as a mappable entity encompassing genetically related petroleum that occurs in seeps, shows and accumulations (discovered or undiscovered) that have been generated by a pod, or by closely related pods, of mature source rock, together with the essental mappable geologic elements (source, reservoir, seal and overburden rocks) that control fundamental processes of generation, migration, entrapment and preservation of petroleum. Total petroleum systems are described by U.S. Geological Survey scientists on the basis of exploration and production histories, and extensive literature searches. Total petroleum systems are identified with a numeric code derived from the numeric code of the World Geologic Provinces as defined by the U.S. Geological Survey World Energy Project. Most total petroleum systems are contained within a single geologic province, but there are numerous cases where systems span more than one province. Summary results of the assessment are presented as attributes of this shapefile.
Purpose:	This shapefile is intended to delineate the Total Petroleum Systems used in the preparation of World Petroleum Assessment 2000 and to present summary assessment results.
